                Black Widow was initially created as a comic book characternamed Natasha Romanova, first appearing as a recurring, <br>
                non-costumed, Russian-spy antagonist in the feature "Iron Man", beginning in Tales of Suspense #52 (April 1964).  <br>
                 Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero  Hawkeye to her cause. <br>
                  Her government later supplies her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually  <br>
                  defects to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series  <br>
                   The Avengers #29 (July 1966). The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its  <br>
                    sixteenth member many years later. Her look was substantially revised in The Amazing Spider-Man #86 (July 1970), <br>
                     with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight <br>
                black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. <br>
